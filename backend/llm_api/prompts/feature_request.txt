            description: "Extreamly detailed description of the task at hand",
            epic: "The epic containing this issue"
        }}
    ],
    solved: true | false,
    extra_details: "Free text where you can embed a discussion of the issues created or the missing information needed to break down the feature into issues"
}}
```
